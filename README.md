## Introduction

YuGen is a productivity and self-growth tool. The motive of the app is not to dynamically tell you what to do, but it’s is a reflection of your day and gives you control over what to do further.

The word _Yūgen_ is said to mean “a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe… and the sad beauty of human suffering”.

YuGen is a very advanced combination of a high complexity ToDo App, Diary and dictaphone that is a perfect fit for any individuals and teams to make use of.

# The Problem and Inspiration

Human psychology is an intriguing subject. Sometimes these small things add up and impact one's life in the longer term.

In the ruthlessly competitive world of the 21st Century, productivity highly contributes to the personal growth and mental health of a person that guarantees survival.

Many people in this world are unable to tap the power of their productivity and that is a major issue and Yugen aims to solve it.

## Business Strategy

- We plan to follow a Freemium Buisness Model.
- An operating strategy to create an intended impact on a personal basis.
- A resonable paid subscription for the team based collaborative features.

## Challenges we faced

- When we got the idea, we were really skeptical on different similar solutions that exist in the market. We ideated on multiple features to make power-packed unique application that stands out in front of the industry leading productivity application
- All the team members synchronize with the product on a personal level that lead to rapid ideation and a personal touch to the product from direct users of the already market ready products.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Detailed psychological research was required because the product was directly in contact with the user psychology.
- Wireframing was very challenging as multiple features had to be integrated in a single application
- Implementing 40+ screens in 36 hours had kept us on our toes the whole time.

## What is next for Yugen

- Watch OS and Desktop App for easy access anywhere anytime.
- Actions on google support for instant access on assistant and smart home devices.
- Integration of services like Zoom and other bots for a quick access bar.
- Giving the user a personalized environment using smart home lighting to have a mental effect of a Pomodoro timer.
- Integrating more user metrics for teams to evauluate performance of its members.
